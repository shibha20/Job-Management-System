# Job Management System

This project is a Java-based job management system that allows users to efficiently manage job applicants. It provides functionalities such as adding new applicants, retrieving a list of all applicants, and searching for applicants based on specific keywords. The system utilizes MongoDB as the database for storing applicant information.

## Features

- **Add Applicant**: Easily add new job applicants to the system by providing their relevant details such as name, contact information, skills, and experience.
- **Retrieve All Applicants**: Retrieve a comprehensive list of all the applicants stored in the system, including their detailed information.
- **Search Applicants**: Perform a keyword-based search to find applicants that match specific criteria, such as skills, experience, or other relevant information.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: The core programming language used to develop the job management system.
- **MongoDB**: The NoSQL database used for storing and managing applicant data.
- **Swagger UI**: Testing of API endpoints can be done using Swagger UI, which provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system.
- **MongoDB Atlas**: The cloud-based database service used to host and manage the MongoDB database.
- **MongoDB Compass**: A graphical user interface tool used for visually exploring and interacting with the MongoDB database.
- **Spring Boot**: The framework used to develop the Java-based application, providing a structured and efficient approach for building RESTful APIs.
- **Maven**: The build automation tool used for managing dependencies and building the project.
- **GitHub**: Version control and code collaboration are facilitated through GitHub, allowing for easy tracking of changes and seamless collaboration with other team members.
- **IntelliJ IDEA**: The integrated development environment (IDE) used for coding, debugging, and managing the project.
